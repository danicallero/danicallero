# hey there!

i'm dani – welcome to my profile! 🌻

### about me 🖋️
i'm a 2nd-ish year cs student at Universidade da Coruña.

i’ve been curious about computers since i was a kid and wrote my first lines of code around age 12.  

these days, i’m focused on deepening my knowledge, exploring new tools, and building things that help me grow as a developer.  

i wouldn’t say i have a “tech stack” yet, but i’m steadily adding more to my toolbox and enjoying the process along the way.
